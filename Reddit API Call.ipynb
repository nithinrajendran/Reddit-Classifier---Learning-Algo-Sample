      "-Exception handlers that just print a static message are close to useless for debugging. Exception handlers that only print the error message aren't much better. You generally want to print the error type, message, any debugging data included with the error, and stack trace. Some of the articles in the example print the first three, but the stack trace is arguably the most important one since you'll see exactly where the error happened and what the call stack looked like.\n",
